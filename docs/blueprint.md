## Core Features:

- Homepage Recreation: Replicate the homepage layout, including the header, featured collections, and footer, ensuring responsiveness across devices.
- Product Listing Clone: Duplicate the product listing page, mirroring the display of items, sorting options, and filtering capabilities. Should be driven by local JSON, since we're not implementing a database.
- Product Detail Replication: Mirror the product detail page, displaying product images, descriptions, pricing, and available options.
- Image carousel: Mimic image carousels present in the reference website.
- Content Generation Tool: Employ a generative AI tool to create product descriptions based on minimal user input. The tool uses a series of product features as inputs to an LLM, and intelligently determines if those product features should be incorporated in the LLM's generated output.
- Contact Form Simulation: Implement a contact form that sends messages to a specified email address.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep plum (#432C3B), to echo the elegance and richness of high-end fashion.
- Background color: Light mauve (#E8D9E2), offering a soft, desaturated backdrop that complements the deep plum.
- Accent color: Dusty rose (#A67B8A), to add a touch of sophistication.
- Font pairing: 'Belleza' for headlines, a humanist sans-serif aligning with fashion, and 'Alegreya' (serif) for body text to provide an elegant, readable experience.
- Use minimalist, line-based icons to maintain a clean and modern aesthetic.
- Employ a grid-based layout to ensure a structured and visually appealing presentation of content.  Mimic layout on reference site, to keep design consistent with reference.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations to enhance user engagement, such as fading effects and smooth scrolling.
